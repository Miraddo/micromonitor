## Technologies and Structure

I am a programmer with a keen interest in various programming languages, especially C/C++ ‚ù§Ô∏è. However, having worked with Go for the past two years, I have chosen this language for my project. Go is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in handling concurrency with ease ‚Äì so it's my choice üòÄ.

Initially, I considered developing the entire project without using any external libraries or frameworks. But upon reflection, I realized that building everything from scratch is akin to reinventing the wheel, which is not ideal. Therefore, I explored various libraries and was particularly excited about one: [Encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore)!

Additionally, I am very fond of the [ArdanLabs Service structure](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service). Its simplicity and clarity make it an excellent fit for any developer, ensuring that everything is organized and easily navigable by name.
